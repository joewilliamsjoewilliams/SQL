SELECT
count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ''
;

--Display how many sales were for iPhones in January

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> ''
AND product = 'iPhone'
;

SELECT
DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
;

--Display the cheapest product sold in January along with the price
SELECT 
product,
MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
LIMIT 1
;
